## How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

Approximately 8 hours in total were spent. I would add ability to produce screenshots and reporting on failed/passed tests in html file. I wanted to spend time resolving my explicit Thread.sleep steps but the restaurant registration test started to fail due to the way the website renders the form wizard at random, which I then had to handle by introducing further page objects and test steps. 

I would also spend more time improving the design pattern on the framework ideally with a developer using OOP. Looking at the feature file, I would split my feature files into respective features i.e. feature file for registration, restaurant search, login.

## What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

Most recent interesting concept for me is Micro services testing especially the contract level testing where different services can be tested and then integrated to test the complete E2E testing of these.

## How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

By analysis and usage of the testing pyramid with the development team to first understand level of coverage (given the skills, time and tools available) that can be automated. Then create sprint deliverables based on these as automated tasks against user stories. I did the exact thing in my current role at Codehouse for UI automation journeys in one project.

## How would you improve the customer experience of the Just Eat website?

From the quality of user experience perspectives, have workshops with customer representatives that include UI/UX team and product owners. In terms of quality of the application, contribute to the user stories sessions with a mind-set of both development team and the end customer.
